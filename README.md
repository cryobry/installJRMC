# install_MC_fedora.sh

**Notes:**
1. 64-bit only
2. This script will not point major upgrades (i.e. from v23 to v24) to the old library. It is recommended to first perform a library backup, install the new major version, and restore the library backup.

**How to install:**
1. Install dpkg and rpm-build (the script will attempt to do this automatically, but there appears to be an issue with the rpm database state in new Fedora releases):
`sudo dnf install dpkg rpm-build`

2. Install or update MC (the script will ask for your sudo password to install packages): 
`./install_MC_fedora.sh 24.0.12` (where 24.0.12 is the current Debian AMD64 version)

3. (Optional) Install your .mjr license: 
  `mediacenter24 /RestoreFromFile YOURMEDIACENTER23MJRFILE.mjr`


**Beta versions:**
The script will look in the autogenerated SOURCES directory for the .deb source package before attempting to download the specified version from the JRiver servers. Thus, if you have access to beta versions you can download the .deb file manually to the SOURCES directory and then start from step #2 above.
